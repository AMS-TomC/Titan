# Titan - DiscordBot Portion
The DiscordBot portion handles the communcation with Discord's websockets to provide real-time updates. The bot's primary role is to push content to the webapp's database to be retrieved at a later time.
It also includes misc. features to moderate guest users, etc.

# Installation
1. TODO, Sorry about that! (Though if you want to get ahead, install the latest discord.py pip package and that will require **Python 3.5**)
