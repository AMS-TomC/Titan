# Titan
There was a time when Discord doesn't support embedding the chat on a webpage. But with Titan, you can! It is as simple as 1, 2, 3!
1. Invite the bot to your server (You must have "Manage Server" permissions)
2. Configure the embed to your liking (toggling guest users, etc)
3. Copy the iframe code and paste the line in your webpage!

# Features
- Guest users (a quick way to invite users who do not have a Discord account)
- Moderation Features (Kick & ban users by IP addresses, toggling guest users)
- Discord OAuth support. (Allows those who have a discord account to access the embed)
- Responsive material design! (Thanks materializecss!!)

# Installation
Would you like to run your own copy of Titan Embeds? There are two parts that integrate nicely together. The webapp (website) handles the frontend and communication with the database to retrieve server messages, etc. The discordbot (bot) handles the communcation
between Discord's websockets and pushing out the data to the database for the webapp. Check out the respective folder for their installation (pay attention to the python versions!) instructions.
